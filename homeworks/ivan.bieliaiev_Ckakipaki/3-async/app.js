/*
Before sending a request for posts, add a timeout of 3 seconds

When opening the page, show the loading and hide it after downloading the posts

Render a list of posts according to the attached layout

Add sorting and title filter to posts that have been rendered.

Sorting has 3 options:
a. Initial version (without sorting)
b. Sort from A to Z
c. Sort from Z to A

In the filter field when entering text, only those posts are displayed whose titles match the text (non-case-sensitive match)
For example: the text "ed T" will leave posts with the titles "red text", "rED T"

Sorting and filtering should work in combination, ie when displaying search results, the selected sorting should be applied to them.
